x	Change ethernet driver to use serial EEPROM
x	Write map-in map-out methods for root node.
x	Write dma-map-in and dma-map-out methods for root node.
x	Change drivers to use map-in rather than assuming a one-one 
	mapping table.

x	Make USER4 at power up prompt for MAC, and IP addresses.
x	Unmap unused portions of the load area and add them to the available
	list of the mmu node.
x	claim/release client interface words should allocate page aligned 
	pieces of physical memory.
x	physical-mappings? virtual address space as well as load area should
	be accounted for in /cpus/cpu#available
x	Context switch on client interfaces calls since stack may not be
	valid.
x	ELF intelligent relocating
x	Get Linux port to work
x	Speed up PS/2 probing when no keyboard is present.
