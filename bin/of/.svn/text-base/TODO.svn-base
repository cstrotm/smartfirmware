TODO/WIBNI list (in no particular order):

multi-threaded support, esp for probing big systems
	move all C global vars into Environ
	split Environ into Forth and Thread environs
		perhaps two global environs - one protected by a lock
	change stack to be per-thread
	need per-thread memory region for "here" and creating new Forth words
		new words and device nodes should be globally visible
		implies large per-thread memory chunks (say 1+Mb?)
		put a lock so only one thread is in compilation-mode at a time?

IPv6 support for DHCPv6
more documentation, esp. intro to OpenFirmware
more debugging of SCSI code, disk/CD driver, NCR driver
add 8042 controller below isa and above keyboard
probe for ISA keyboard and mouse
VGA needs proper initialization code
pcidisp should detect if VGA-compatible mode and use vga driver
floppy driver
rlogin/telnet module ala term - requires TCP module, which will be a pain
set USB keyboard extended-keyboard flag?
USB support for mass-storage devices
USB support for UHCI host controller
dnum parsing from command line - just a hack right now

A few of TODO's for the PCI code.
-	VGA and IDE class devices need to have the legacy I/O addresses
	in addition to whatever is probed in the BARs are part of their
	reg property (and assigned-addresses)
-	All devices except VGA and IDE class devices should be have their
	I/O and MEM enable bits set in the PCI config CSR for the
	device.
-	VGA and IDE class devices should be completely disabled and
	the I/O and/or MEM enable bits set in the open method.

spiffy menu-driven user-friendly front-end:
    1) see and set nvram parameters
    2) see devices
    3) see files under disks
    4) boot devices or files
    5) run user-interface (Forth prompt)
    6) reset-all
    7) probe-all?


(DONE) nvedit no longer limited to just one screen of text
(DONE) read actual hardware addr from decether ROM
(DONE) auto-netotiation/sensing in decether driver
(DONE) PCI devices should be disabled by close methods
(DONE) SCSI-bus layer that is board/chip independent + SCSI disk drivers
(DONE) ncrscsi driver should at least read blocks - write is too dangerous
(DONE) 8-bit graphics extension to fb.c
(DONE) 16-color text extension to display.c and fb.c
(DONE) new filesystem sypport for DOS, BSD - list-files and load
(DONE) plug-in machine-independent binary-format launchers
(DONE) display-window version for X11 and BeOS as for Mac
(DONE) new output-capture buffer to catch tail of large dumps
(DONE) command-line editing
(DONE) backward/forward-word for cmd-line and nvedit
(DONE) support Fcode spread value of 0 correctly for loop/branch constructs
       - we now compile Fcode constructs instead of running them directly,
       so this should just work
(DONE) added 16 and 32-bits-per-pixel modes to fb.c and mac.c
(DONE) command-line completion
(DONE) iso9660 filesystem plug-in
(DONE) detailed help system scaffold
(DONE) DHCP support in obp-tftp
(DONE) external/headers/headerless support now complete
(DONE) basic USB support for keyboards (boot protocol) and hubs

For Peritek:
(DONE) make dl handle binaries - figure out length of images to dl
(DONE) make elf2tekhex program to generate PROM image from ELF binary
(DONE) convert tokenizer output into PCI FCode PROM image format
(DONE) a.out exe loader
