TODO:
----
see if it is possible to use cache as a small stack+bss memory
probe DRAM ROMs to init Hammer properly (start1.as86)
generalize HT init code - probably in asm
add ACPI/intr info into device tree
Adaptec and Tekram SCSI drivers
builtin ethernet driver
EHCI USB driver
modify NetBSD to boot under SF in 64-bit mode using OF interface:
    pass in command-line args
    set boot/root disk
    walk OF tree using client-interface
    do not switch to 64-bit mode if already in 64-bit mode
port Linux to boot under SF in 64-bit mode using OF interface
add proper BSD/Linux boot-loaders that understand OF
shipping mobos and specs
write HT and AMD64 OF bindings
compress primary firmware image - support two for failsafe?
multiple CPU support/init
Add NVRAM in flash support
Fix problem with flash driver that prevents SST49LF080A from programming
	correctly.  Working with SST on the problem currently.
Add named NVRAM parameter sets, so that it is easy to switch configurations.
Add operating-system type auto that uses elf header info to figure out
	what OS just got loaded.


DONE or irrelevant:
------------------
see what problem with ISA-compat timer is, or use other timer - u_sleep()
SIO chip inited
init CPU ID reg (move dump_hammer to of.ram & dump it out)
init IRQ regs in PCI devs
PCI bug re Sparc?


FLASH REGIONS:
-------------
nvram
nvram.prev
mini-firmware (highest 64Kb)
primary firmware (SF)
additional fcode drivers (users may add?)
kernel?
