<H1><A NAME="SmartFirmware-User-Manual"></A>SmartFirmware User Manual</H1>
<P>This document describes the SmartFirmware User Interface, and how to use it
to manipulate device trees, view and set parameter values, and to control
boot-up procedures.</P>
<H2>Basics</H2>
<P>SmartFirmware is an implementation of the <A HREF="http://playground.sun.com/pub/1275/home.html">OpenFirmware
</A> IEEE standard 1275-1994 plus errata changes.</P>
<P>The basis of SmartFirmware is a <A HREF="http://www.taygeta.com/forth.html">Forth
</A> engine. Forth is essentially a stack-based language, much like the
well-known Hewlett-Packard calculators. Forth &quot;words&quot; are names that
are executed when they are typed in at the &quot;ok&quot; prompt.</P>
<P>For instance, to add two numbers, type &quot;3 4 +. cr&quot; at the prompt.
This sequence first pushes the number '3' then the number '4' onto the stack.
The '+' then pops and adds the top two stack elements and pushes the result on
the stack. The &quot;.&quot; pops and displays the sum on the top of the
stack, namely the value '7'. The &quot;cr&quot; simply displays a
carriage-return and doesn't affect the stack.</P>
<P>This document expands upon the built-in &quot;help&quot; Forth word.
</P>
<H2>Devices</H2>
<P>A device is a node in a tree, much as a file in a Unix file-path. A device
name is usually of the form &quot;/name@addr1,addr2:options/dev2/...&quot;.
All the portions of a device path are machine-dependent. An example of a path
is &quot;/duart@C0800A00/uart@1:19200,9600,8,1,N&quot;. The &quot;@addr&quot;
and &quot;:options&quot; portions of the name may be left out, in which case
the first matching name is used (&quot;/duart/uart&quot; for the previous example).
</P>
<P>Devices may also have aliases for convenience. For instance, the alias
&quot;tty&quot; may refer to &quot;/duart@C0800A00/uart@0&quot;, and may then
be referred to with &quot;tty:19200,9600,8,1,N&quot; with options if desired.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="Displaying"></A>Displaying</H4>
<P>Devices can be listed using the &quot;ls&quot; command from the
SmartFirmware User Interface. The &quot;dev&quot; or &quot;cd&quot; commands
(which are synonyms) moves around the device tree. The &quot;pwd&quot; command
shows the current device being accessed.</P>
<P>The command &quot;show-devs&quot; lists all devices in the device tree. The
command &quot;.properties&quot; can be used to display all property lists at
any node in the device tree, after using &quot;dev&quot; to first open that device.
</P>
<P><A NAME="pwd"></A><B>pwd</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Print current (working) device path.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="ls"></A><B>ls</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Show all devices at the current point in the device tree.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="dev"></A><B>dev &lt;device path&gt;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="cd"></A><B>cd &lt;device path&gt;</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Change the currently open device to the one specified on the command-line.
The path may be relative to the current device. The path may also be the
string &quot;..&quot; to open the parent of the current device. The device
will also parse any optional arguments to configure the device, if any are provided.
</P>
<P>Example: cd /duart@C0800A00:9600</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="show-devs"></A><B>show-devs</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Show all the devices in the device tree.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME=".properties"></A><B>.properties</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Show all the properties of the current device.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="words"></A><B>words</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Show all the methods of the current device, or all the Forth words if there
is no current device.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="devalias"></A><B>devalias [name string]</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Show all the device aliases currently defined if nothing is on the command
line. Otherwise, create a device alias called &quot;name&quot; with the value
of &quot;string&quot;. This is handy to avoid typing in long path names again
and again. Useful in &quot;nvramrc&quot; scripts (below).</P>
<P>Example: devalias tty /duart@C0800A00/uart@0</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Parameter settings</H2>
<P>Parameter settings are stored in non-volatile memory (NVRAM). They affect a
variety of SmartFirmware activities from bootup to running custom scripts to
setting the size of the display window.</P>
<P>Parameters are simply string value pairs that usually have a default value
(stored in ROM) and an active value (stored in NVRAM). They may be displayed,
set, and restored using the following commands.</P>
<P>The supported parameter variables are described in the <A HREF="#Parameter-variables">next
section</A>.</P>
<P>The following commands are used to manipulate NVRAM parameter settings:
</P>
<P><A NAME="printenv"></A><B>printenv [var]</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Display all parameter variables, their current values, and their default
values if no &quot;var&quot; is specified on the command-line. Otherwise just
display the values for that variable.</P>
<P>Example: printenv diag-switch?</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="setenv"></A><B>setenv var string value</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Set the value of &quot;var&quot; to be &quot;string value&quot;. Everything
up to the end of the line, including spaces, will be stored in NVRAM.</P>
<P>Example: setenv diag-switch? true</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="set-default"></A><B>set-default var</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Set the value of &quot;var&quot; to be its default value. This is handy to
restore some variable whose value may have gotten scrambled for some reason.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="set-defaults"></A><B>set-defaults</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Set all parameter values back to their default values. This is handy if
NVRAM has become corrupted.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvedit"></A><B>nvedit</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Edit the script stored in parameter &quot;nvramrc&quot;. This opens up a
very simple Emacs-style text editor with the contents of the
&quot;nvramrc&quot; variable.</P>
<P>Type ^C (Control-C) to exit. Most of the usual Emacs commands may be used
to move the cursor around, including ^F (forward-char), ^B (backward-char), ^N
(next-line), and ^P (previous-line).</P>
<P>This command does not alter the contents of &quot;nvramrc&quot; but merely
edits a copy in memory. See &quot;nvstore&quot;, &quot;nvquit&quot;,
&quot;nvrecover&quot;, and &quot;nvrun&quot; (below).</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvstore"></A><B>nvstore</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stores the contents of the current &quot;nvedit&quot; buffer into the
parameter variable &quot;nvramrc&quot;. See &quot;nvedit&quot; (above).
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvquit"></A><B>nvquit</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Erase the contents of the nvedit buffer without storing it. Prompts the
user to confirm before erasing the buffer. Does not alter the contents of
&quot;nvramrc&quot;. See &quot;nvedit&quot; (above).</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvrecover"></A><B>nvrecover</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Attempts to recover the contents of nvedit after it has been erased.
Normally &quot;nvstore&quot; is supposed to erase the contents of the edit
buffer. SmartFirmware does not do this, so nvrecover is effectively
non-functional. See &quot;nvedit&quot; and &quot;nvstore&quot; (above).
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvrun"></A><B>nvrun</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Execute the contents of the nvedit buffer as Forth code. Handy way to make
sure that the &quot;nvramrc&quot; script works before committing it to NVRAM.
See &quot;nvedit&quot; (above).</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvalias"></A><B>nvalias alias device</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Add a &quot;devalias&quot; to the &quot;nvramrc&quot; script to create this
alias at bootup. If there is already a &quot;devalias&quot; command there,
edit it to point to this new device. Finally, run the new &quot;devalias&quot;
command so the alias is available for immediate use. This is a short-cut
operation for most typical uses of &quot;nvramrc&quot;.</P>
<P>Example: nvalias tty /duart@C0800A00/uart@0</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvunalias"></A><B>nvunalias alias</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Remove the specified &quot;devalias&quot; command for creating this alias
at bootup from the &quot;nvramrc&quot; script, if there is one there.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="Parameter-variables"></A>Parameter variables</H2>
<P>Parameter variables are manipulated by the commands described in the
previous section. Most are used during bootup and are guarded by boolean
parameters to turn features on or off. All these variables may not be present
on all systems. For instance, if the system does not support booting, none of
the boot parameter vars would be of much use.</P>
<P><A NAME="diag-switch"></A><B>diag-switch?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boolean: &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Switch on diagnostic-mode
if true, which turns on extended tests, more verbose output, and alters the
boot commands below.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="secondary-diag"></A><B>secondary-diag?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boolean: &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Switch
secondary-diagnostics on or off at bootup. This is not a standard OpenFirmware
parameter and controls additional comprehensive test routines for SmartFirmware.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="auto-boot"></A><B>auto-boot?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boolean: &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. If true, execute the word
in &quot;boot-command&quot; after the standard bootup process. Otherwise run
the Forth interpreter on the console and display an &quot;ok&quot; prompt.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="auto-boot-timeout"></A><B>auto-boot-timeout</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Integer: number of milliseconds, usually 500. This is the amount of time to
wait (in milliseconds) for a key-press to abort auto-boot. This is not a
standard OpenFirmware parameter.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="boot-command"></A><B>boot-command</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>String: usually &quot;boot&quot;. The command to execute to boot the system
if the variable &quot;auto-boot?&quot; is true.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="boot-device"></A><B>boot-device</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>String: usually &quot;disk&quot;. The device to use to load the boot image
when &quot;boot&quot; is executed. The string is usually an alias to the
actual device.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="boot-file"></A><B>boot-file</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>String: usually blank. The file to load from the &quot;boot-device&quot;
when &quot;boot&quot; is executed.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="diag-device"></A><B>diag-device</B></P>
<P><A NAME="diag-file"></A><B>diag-file</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Like &quot;boot-device&quot; and &quot;boot-file&quot;, but are used if
&quot;diag-switch&quot; is true when &quot;boot&quot; is executed. Typical
values are &quot;net&quot; and &quot;diag&quot; respectively, where
&quot;net&quot; is typically an alias to a network device.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="use-nvramrc"></A><B>use-nvramrc?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boolean: &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. If true, execute the
contents of &quot;nvramrc&quot; at bootup.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="nvramrc"></A><B>nvramrc</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The script to execute at bootup. This script is only executed if
&quot;use-nvramrc?&quot; is set to true (below).</P>
<P>The normal bootup sequence is: &quot;probe-all install-console
banner&quot;. If an &quot;nvramrc&quot; script is provided, it should perform
the above three in the same order to make sure that the device tree is probed
and ready. If these commands are not executed in the &quot;nvramrc&quot;
script, then they will be executed by SmartFirmware once the script finishes running.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="input-device"></A><B>input-device</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>String: usually &quot;keyboard&quot;. The device path to use for the
console input. The device &quot;keyboard&quot; is usually an alias to the
actual input device determined in some machine-dependent fashion.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="output-device"></A><B>output-device</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>String: usually &quot;screen&quot;. The device to use for console output.
Again, this is usually an alias to the actual device.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="screen-#rows"></A><B>screen-#rows</B></P>
<P><A NAME="screen-#columns"></A><B>screen-#columns</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Integer: usually 0. The number of rows and columns desired for the console
output. If zero, the largest allowable number will be used depending upon the
font used.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="inverse-video"></A><B>inverse-video</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boolean: &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Display text on the console
as black-on-white if this parameter is true, else as white-on-black. This is
not a standard OpenFirmware parameter.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="oem-banner"></A><B>oem-banner?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boolean: &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. If true, display the
contents of &quot;oem-banner&quot; when the command &quot;banner&quot; is
executed in place of the default banner string.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="oem-banner"></A><B>oem-banner</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>String to display when the &quot;banner&quot; command is executed, if
&quot;oem-banner?&quot; is set to true.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="oem-logo"></A><B>oem-logo?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boolean: &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. If true, display the bitmap
in &quot;oem-logo&quot; in front of the banner when the command
&quot;banner&quot; is executed. Otherwise a default logo (or no logo) will be displayed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="oem-logo"></A><B>oem-logo</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Bitmap: 64x64x1 (512 bytes). The bitmap to display if &quot;oem-logo?&quot;
is true. The contents may be machine-dependent.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="Booting"></A>Booting</H2>
<P>The bootup process is as follows, as required by the OpenFirmware standard.
The process is largely machine-dependent but the steps are the same for all platforms:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Power-on self-test
<LI>System initialization
<LI>Evaluate the script &quot;nvramrc&quot; if &quot;use-nvramrc?&quot; is true.
<LI>If the script was not executed or if there was no console after the script
finished executing, then:
<OL>
<LI>Execute &quot;probe-all&quot; (evaluates FCode)
<LI>Execute &quot;install-console&quot;
<LI>Execute &quot;banner&quot;</OL>
<LI>Secondary diagnostics, if &quot;secondary-diag?&quot; is true, and other
system-dependent initialization.
<LI>Default boot if &quot;auto-boot?&quot; is true and no key is held down.
<LI>Run the Forth command interpreter (if not booted)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</OL>
<P>Commands for booting include:</P>
<P><A NAME="boot"></A><B>boot [device] [args]</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boot the specified device with arguments, if any. If args is not specified,
use the contents of the parameter &quot;boot-file&quot; or
&quot;diag-file&quot; depending on the current setting of
&quot;diag-switch?&quot;. If device is not specified, use
&quot;boot-device&quot; or &quot;diag-device&quot; instead. &quot;boot&quot;
is the same as a &quot;load&quot; followed by a &quot;go&quot; (below).
</P>
<P>Example: boot /flash pterm</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="load"></A><B>load [device] [args]</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As boot above, except do not actually boot, but do everything else to
prepare an image for booting. Run the &quot;go&quot; command to actually boot.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="go"></A><B>go</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Boot the image that was prepared with &quot;load&quot; above.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="probe-all"></A><B>probe-all</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Probes the system for all devices and builds the device tree. Used in the
&quot;nvramrc&quot; script. Should only be called once at bootup.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="install-console"></A><B>install-console</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Selects and installs a console from the device tree, typically a screen and
keyboard or a serial-port. Used in the &quot;nvramrc&quot; script. Should only
be called once at bootup.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="banner"></A><B>banner</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Display the bootup system banner, optionally with a custom color logo. This
is usually called in the &quot;nvramrc&quot; script at bootup, but is safe to
execute multiple times.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>
<H3>Net-booting</H3>
<P>Booting over a network device is probably the most useful feature of
SmartFirmware. SmartFirmware supports the standard UDP/IP protocols of BOOTP,
DHCP, or RARP for configuring a network device, and TFTP for loading an images
over that network device.</P>
<P>The commands ``load'' and ``boot'' (described above) when used with a
network device accept the following optional device-specific arguments as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
<P><B>net:[dopt,][prto,]sia,fname,cia,gia,bret,tret [args]</B></P>
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>``net'' may be a device alias or a device-path to an ethernet device.
</P>
<P>``dopt'' are device-specific options. SmartFirmware's builtin ethernet
drivers support the strings ``promiscuous'', ``speed=10'', ``speed=100'',
``duplex=full'', and ``duplex=half'', assuming the device supports the
specific capability. The options may be in any order and must be separated by
commas. Additional options may also be supported by a specific driver.
</P>
<P> ``prto'' is optional and specifies which network boot protocol to be used.
SmartFirmware supports the strings ``bootp'', ``dhcp'' or ``rarp'' to force
BOOTP, DHCP, or RARP protocols to be used. BOOTP is the default on most
platforms (although Sparcs may use RARP).</P>
<P>``sia'' is the server internet address in dotted octet or hexadecimal
format of the server that will be used for TFTP.</P>
<P>``fname'' is the name of the file to be downloaded over the network using TFTP.
</P>
<P>``cia'' is the internet address that SmartFirmware will use for its local
(client) interface address.</P>
<P>``giadr' is the internet address of the gateway between the local interface
and the server if such a gateway is present.</P>
<P>``bret'' and ``tret'' are decimal numbers and indicate the number of times
that retries will be sent before the BOOTP or TFTP operations fail.</P>
<P>``args'' are the optional arguments passed to the program when it is executed.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>All device arguments are optional, but the commas separating the arguments
are required. Any missing fields are filled in by the information returned
using BOOTP/DHCP/RARP protocols. Thus the simplest way to boot over a network
device is simply ``boot net''. ``boot net:,file'' boots a specific file over
the net.</P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="Testing"></A>Testing</H2>
<P>It is possible to exercise some of the test methods from the Forth command
prompt. If the parameter variable &quot;diag-switch?&quot; is true, then more
verbose and more thorough tests are turned on. It may be useful to run the
non-verbose commands at bootup, if desired. The commands are as follows.
</P>
<P><A NAME="test"></A><B>test [device]</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Test the specified device (or the currently open device if none is
specified) by executing its &quot;selftest&quot; method. This may also turn on
LEDs or other indicators that testing is in progress.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="test-all"></A><B>test-all [device]</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Run all &quot;selftest&quot; methods recursively at and below the specified
device (or &quot;/&quot; if no device is specified). This runs all tests on
the requested node, then on all its children, and their children, and so
on.Typically used to run all the tests on all devices from &quot;/&quot;.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="Changing-the-console"></A>Changing the console</H2>
<P>The console device used may be changed at any time, or selected during
bootup. To change it during bootup, the typical method is to either change the
NVRAM parameters &quot;input-device&quot; and &quot;output-device&quot; to the
desired console device, or add &quot;devalias&quot; commands to
&quot;nvramrc&quot; to change the aliases for &quot;screen&quot; and
&quot;keyboard&quot; to the desired console.</P>
<P>Otherwise, the console may be changed on-the-fly using the following Forth
words. Note that they expect their parameters on the Forth stack and not on
the command-line as do most of the commands above.</P>
<P><A NAME="input"></A><B>input (device-str str-len --)</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Used by first pushing a string containing the desired device onto the Forth
stack, then executing the word &quot;input&quot;. The console input will be
immediately changed unless an error occurs. Example: &quot;
/duart/uart@0&quot; input</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="output"></A><B>output (device-str str-len --)</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Changes the current console output device.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="io"></A><B>io (device-str str-len --)</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Changes both the input and the output device at one time. Only useful if
the device is capable of both input and output.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="Forth-variables"></A>Forth variables</H2>
<P>Forth variables may be viewed and set using standard Forth words. Some
additional variables have been added for SmartFirmware that are not part of
the OpenFirmware standard.</P>
<P>To view a Forth variable called, say, &quot;lines/page&quot;, use
&quot;.&quot; to display the value on the top of the stack and &quot;cr&quot;
to print a carriage-return:</P>
<PRE>
<P>ok lines/page . cr</P>
</PRE>
<P>To set a Forth variable, the new value must be first pushed onto the Forth
stack before using the &quot;to&quot; word:</P>
<PRE>
<P>ok -1 to lines/page</P>
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P><A NAME="lines-page"></A><B>lines/page</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The current number of lines per page specified for automatic pagination of
the output. If the value is zero, no pagination is performed. If the value is
negative, it is subtracted from the number of lines in the display. Otherwise
the value specifies how many lines are to be displayed before a
&quot;More&quot; prompt temporarily stops the output.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="scroll-step"></A><B>scroll-step</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The number of lines to scrol l the display by when at the bottom of the
screen. This can speed up slower frame buffers by scrolling by 4 lines instead
of 1, for instance.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
