Environment variables for controlling gcmalloc.

GC_AFTER_PAGES

	Minimum number of pages to allow the heap to expand after the heap
	has become exhuasted.

GC_MIN_PAGES

	Minimum number of pages to allow the heap to expand after the heap
	has become xhausted.

GC_MIN_ALIGN

	Minimum block alignment.  The default is four bytes.

GC_MAX_ALIGN

	Maximum block alignment.  All blocks smaller that this value are
	aligned to GC_MIN_ALIGN.  All block larger than this value are 
	aligned to this value.  The default is 64 bytes.

GC_IGNORE_FREE

	If non zero then calls to free are ignored an all memory is reclaimed
	through garbage collection.  This can sometimes be faster than 
	actually freeing the blocks at the time that free is called.  The
	default is to not ignore calls to free.

GC_PERCENT

	Percent of the heap that must be available for allocation to prevent
	the heap from growing between garbage collections.

GC_CLEAR_BLOCKS

	If non zero then call to malloc with cause the block to be initialized
	to zero.  This is useful if blocks are not completely initialized
	after allocation.

GC_SNAPSHOT

	Causes stack snapshots to be kept for every block that is allocated.

GC_SKIP_INTERIOR

	Causes to the garbage collector to only search for pointers to the
	start of blocks.  Potential pointers to a block that point into
	the interior of the block are not considered to reference the
	block.  This option is not particularly useful and is not 
	recommended.

GC_DUMPFILE

	Caused the state of the heap to be save to this file name
	at program termination.
